    <h1 class="header">Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
    <p class="center-text">
        My name is Isaac, and I’ve been passionate about programming, 
        software and computers since I was 10. My older brother and his friends 
        became infatuated with building custom computers. 
        One day, one of his friends donated his old PC to our family. 
        It was through this that I discovered a love for programming at a 
        young age through watching YouTube documentaries on video game development. 
        Whenever I had projects in middle school, I would create small games that 
        showcased something about the subject, such as Math or English, using 
        Scratch (scratch.mit.edu). Through Scratch’s incredibly intuitive 
        proprietary programming language, I learned how to solve problems using 
        code, and how to write simple and effective code. My assets, such as the 
        characters and backgrounds, were dubious at best, but I eventually moved on 
        to using the Unity game engine, as well as Blender. As my thirst for 
        knowledge and creation grew, I would feverishly bookmark documentation 
        pages on other programming languages such as C#, C++ and Python. I would 
        spend time during class getting assignments done early so I could use my 
        school-given laptop to continue my research (they were some of the only 
        sites that weren’t blocked.)
    </p>
    <p class="center-text">
        Eventually, however, I ran out of motivation to continue making games. I 
        started to hit brick walls in my projects, and I lost all my momentum. 
        Suffering the effects of burnout, I took a short hiatus from programming 
        around the time I was 13 or 14. However, my Father introduced my to a 
        website called The Odin Project a short time later. It’s a free, self-paced 
        curriculum that teaches the ins-and-outs of front-end web development. I 
        became eager at the prospect of being able to write code as a career. And as 
        a side note, I still get very excited just at the thought of writing code. 
        Sometimes, I even dream about writing code. But back to the story, after 
        finishing about 50% of the course, the realization hit me that I did not 
        enjoy working with CSS or HTML. The thought of opening up VS Code or (insert 
        favorite IDE here) to write boilerplate HTML makes my heart sink a little. 
        Throughout the rest of my teenage years and after I graduated high school, I 
        knew that I wanted to work with code in some way. It wasn’t until about a 
        year ago that my passion was renewed after finding Boot.dev, a course that 
        focuses on back-end web development. Instead of writing HTML or dying inside 
        writing classes and containers in CSS, I was solving problems. And that is, 
        as I’ve discovered, what I am most passionate about: <b>solving problems using 
        programming.</b> Programming is really magical, when you think about it. Andy 
        Gavin, the lead programmer behind Naughty Dog’s early games, said on his 
        blog: <i>“Being a programmer is like being a wizard.”</i> Once you’re writing http 
        requests in Go, creating awesome hash tables in Python, or memorizing your 
        binary trees (ha), you really start to feel the computer bending to your 
        whim. This passion carries me throughout my projects. Whenever I feel 
        overwhelmed by complex problems, and whenever I start learning new 
        programming languages or technologies (something I’ll probably never stop 
        doing, honestly), I remind myself of why I became obsessed with programming
        to begin with: <b>I love it.</b>

    <h1 class="header">What is this website's purpose?</h1>
    <p class="center-text">
        I will start hosting some of my web-based projects on here. I want to keep the design simple for two reasons. One, it’s fast, and it works. Two, I HATE CSS. Ahem. Check back frequently, as I almost always have a new project that I cooked up after waking up at 2 AM from a fever dream.
